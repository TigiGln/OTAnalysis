OTAnalysis
==========

# Tool for managing the results of optical tweezers
Tool for extracting, analyzing and classifying optical tweezer data curves

## Flow of the use process
Launch on an interface allowing to select the parameters for a file analysis in back-end

### Condition of the experience
- condition: Name of the antibody present on the beads during the experiment
- drug: name of the drug used for the analysis if present

### Fitting management
Selection of the curve files to be analyzed either by selecting a directory or with the multiple selection of files
- model: The model used to fit the "Press" curves (linear or sphere)
If selected sphere, appearance of the physical parameters menu for the calculation of the Young's modulus
- eta: Poisson's ratio
- bead rdius: diameter of the ball used during the experiment

### Management of curve anomalies
Curve management parameters Incomplete (no analysis possible) or misaligned (analysis but warning)
- pulling length min : minimum percentage of the length of the "Pull" segment to determine if the curve is rejected despite the presence of all the segments indicated in the header
- Fmax epsilon: percentage of max force on the major axis to determine misalignment of the curve on the minor axes

### Classification condition
- NAD if jump is < (PN): force condition to classify non-adhesive curves < pN
- AD if position is < (nm): distance condition to separate the membership from the tubes
- AD if slope is < (pts): condition number of points to separate the membership of the tubes
- Factor overcome noise (xSTD): Number of times the standard deviation for the calculation of the characteristic points
- Factor optical effect (xSTD): Number of times the standard deviation to correct the optical effect

Appearance of a method loading button after loading data to redo a past analysis.

## Menu after launching the analysis
Three possible options:
- Supervised: Allows you to switch to a new window with the display of curves and a supervisory menu
- Unsupervised: Allows you to retrieve the output file of the automatic analysis
- ...with graphs: Allows you to retrieve the output file of the automatic analysis completed with all the graphs

If we choose supervised:
## Graphic display window with supervision
Visualization of all curves as a function of time on the 3 axes and as a function of distance on the main_axis

### Supervision menu
- Close supervision Panel: Possibility to close this menu for a more important visualization of the curves
- Buttons to navigate between the curves. Can be operated with the left/right arrow keys
- Button to save the displayed graphic
- Button to save the output file with an indication that the supervision is stopped at this curve (treat_supervised column)
- curve name
- button for zooming with characteristic point and fit on distance curves (Pull and Press segment only)
- if curve misaligned warning of misalignment axis with a possibility to change this status
- fit validation of the Press segment
- management of the optical correction with a post-analysis control
- fit validation of the Pull segment
- correction of the type of curve classification (type defined checked)
- Pagination to determine our position in the whole analysis. Possibility to move with the 'Enter' key and the number of the curve

### Changes in points and fits
In the supervision interface, you can modify the characteristic points and curve fits:
Go to the force vs distance curve
In the menu press Edit/Pick event
in the secondary window that appears choose what you want to modify and click on OK
then click on the graph:
- on the selected point
- on the two extreme points for the fit

## Add features
To add a feature, two options are possible: 
- During the automatic analysis 
- After analysis for post processing

### In analysis
We need to add a method to the curve object
then call it in the "analyzed_curve" method of the curve object
This method is called by the controller when the automatic analysis is launched

### In interface
If we want to call an external post processing script: 
 - we create a method in the controller that loops on the dict_curve (dictionnare of curved object)
 - we adapt our add script so that it includes the data of the object
 - We then create a widget in the interface that calls the method of the view's controller attribute
if we want to add a new feature after analysis but on the object *curve :  
 - we add a method to curve
 - we create a widget that calls this method through the dict-curve of the controller

 ## Adapt input
 The input text file must have a global header, a calibration part, segment headers and data
 ![Screenshot](./pictures/structure_file_text.png)
 
 If your data do not have a force (xsignal1, ysignal1, zsignal1), time (seriesTime) and distance column:
- You will have to implement methods in the specific curve object of your data
- modify the start of the analysis in the controller in the "create_dict_curves" method
- adapt the supervision to the data to display
